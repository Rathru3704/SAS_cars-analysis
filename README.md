# US Cars Market Analysis (SAS Project)

## Overview
This SAS project demonstrates advanced proficiency in SAS, including **Data Step processing, PROC statements, ODS, SQL queries, data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and reporting**. The analysis uses the built-in SAS dataset `SASHELP.CARS` to explore characteristics of US cars with high horsepower, and to compare them against other origins.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**
  - View dataset structure with `PROC CONTENTS`
  - Display sample data with `PROC PRINT`
  - Summary statistics with `PROC MEANS`
  - Frequency counts with `PROC FREQ`

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
  - Filter US cars with horsepower greater than 200
  - Create derived variables such as `Power_to_Weight` and `Efficiency_Rating`
  - Categorize cars by horsepower tiers (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`)

- **Advanced Analysis**
  - Compare US vs Non-US cars using `PROC TTEST`
  - Correlation analysis with `PROC CORR`
  - Aggregated summaries by car type using `PROC SQL`
  - SQL query to select top cars by Power-to-Weight ratio

- **Visualization**
  - Boxplots, scatter plots, and histograms with `PROC SGPLOT`
  - Correlation plots

- **Reporting**
  - Beautiful tables using `PROC REPORT`
  - Export reports in **HTML, PDF, and RTF** formats using ODS

## File Description
- `Cars_Analysis.sas` : Complete SAS script with detailed English comments for every step
- `cars_report.html` : Example HTML report generated by the script
- `cars_report.pdf` : Example PDF report generated by the script

## How to Run
1. Open `Cars_Analysis.sas` in SAS Studio or your preferred SAS environment.
2. Run the script step by step or all at once.
3. The reports (`cars_report.html`, `cars_report.pdf`) will be generated in the working directory.
4. Review the visualizations, summary tables, and top cars by Power-to-Weight ratio.
